**Cons:** Higher paid tiers may hurt conversion

---

## Recommended Strategy: Option B

### Rationale
1. **Free tier is essential** for ad conversion (research shows 5-10% free→paid)
2. **$5 entry point** removes psychological barrier ($9 feels like $10)
3. **Better value perception** improves word-of-mouth
4. **Still profitable** at 82-87% gross margins

### Implementation Priority

| Priority | Action | Effort | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | Add free tier (3-5 credits) | Low | High |
| **P1** | Lower Starter to $5 | Low | High |
| **P2** | Adjust Pro to $19 | Low | Medium |
| **P3** | Adjust Business to $49 | Low | Medium |

## Key Insights to Apply

### 1. Target Audience Alignment ✅
BlankLogo's focus on **AI video watermarks** (Sora, Runway, Pika) is a **niche within the niche**:
- Less competition than general watermark removal
- Higher willingness to pay (AI video creators are early adopters)
- Specific platforms = targeted marketing

### 2. Pain Points to Address in Marketing
| Pain Point | Current Messaging | Recommended |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Expensive tools | Not emphasized | Lead with price comparison |
| Time-consuming | Mentioned | Add "instant" / "seconds" |
| No subscription | Not emphasized | Make primary message |
| Platform-specific | ✅ Good | Keep this unique angle |

### 3. Ad Strategy for BlankLogo

#### Primary Channels (Based on Research)
| Channel | Why | Budget |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **TikTok** | Same audience as Sora/Pika users | $500/mo |
| **YouTube** | AI video tutorials | $300/mo |
| **Reddit** | r/StableDiffusion, r/midjourney | $200/mo |

#### Ad Copy Angles
```
Cost Savings:
"Sora watermarks ruining your videos? Remove them for $0.50 each"

Speed:
"Remove AI video watermarks in 30 seconds - not 30 minutes"

No Subscription:
"Pay per video, not per month. No Sora watermark subscription BS"
```

### 4. Conversion Funnel to Implement

```
TikTok/YouTube Ad ("Free watermark removal")
              ↓

         ↓         ↓

         ↓         ↓
     Upsell     Converts?
```

### 5. Email Sequences to Build

|----------|---------|------|

## Updated Unit Economics (Option B Pricing)

### With Free Tier + Lower Prices

| Free→Paid Conv | N/A | 8% | New |

# BlankLogo Marketing & Ad Framework

> Static ad framework for problem-aware + solution-aware audiences

---

## 1. Ideal Customer + Awareness Mapping

### Problem-Aware (feel pain, not committed to a solution)

**Who:** TikTok/IG creators, UGC editors, social media managers, small brands, agencies

**Pain:** "This watermark ruins the post / client deliverable / ad creative."

**They respond to:**
- "Fix this in minutes"
- "Don't re-edit the whole thing"
- "Don't download sketchy apps"
- "Don't lose quality"

### Solution-Aware (already tried tools)

**Who:** Same people, but already searched "remove watermark from video"

**Pain:** "Everything I tried is a scam / blurry / takes forever / makes me watch ads / adds a new watermark."

**They respond to:**
- "Ad-free premium output"
- "HQ export"
- "Works on real videos"
- "Faster + cleaner than typical web tools"

---

## 2. Positioning: Define the "Ideal Solution"

### The Ideal Watermark Removal Solution (anchor promise)

- **Clean removal** - no blur blobs, no weird smears
- **Preserves quality** - no "looks like 480p" output
- **Fast turnaround** - minutes, not hours
- **Ad-free / not annoying**
- **Simple flow** - upload → process → download
- **Reliable** - doesn't fail silently, clear status
- **Privacy-respectful** - don't feel like you're donating footage to a random tool

### BlankLogo Ad Claims

- "Premium watermark removal (ad-free)"
- "High-quality output (designed to keep video looking sharp)"
- "No extra watermark"
- "Built for creators who post daily"
- "Simple: Upload → Remove → Download"

> **Important:** "Best" is a position, not a claim you need to legally prove. Instead of "we are the best," use proof-style creative and contrast language: "Designed to avoid the usual…" / "Built for…" / "Premium + ad-free."

---

## 3. How to "Invalidate Other Providers" Safely

*No names, no defamation - use contrast frames*

### A) "Most tools" vs "BlankLogo"

| Most Tools | BlankLogo |
|------------|-----------|
| Blurry output | Cleaner removal |
| Smear patches | Ad-free premium experience |
| Endless ads | Quality-first export |
| Fake progress bar | |
| New watermark | |

### B) "If you've tried the usual…"

> "If you've tried 3 sites and they all ruined the video… this is the one built for clean results."

### C) "What we refuse to do"

> "No forced app install. No ad walls. No 'HD' bait-and-switch."

### D) Premium positioning

> "This is a premium utility. The point is: it works."

## 4. Static Ad Formats (High-Trust)

Easiest formats to mass-produce with screenshots + Remotion:

1. **Before / After split** - frame from the same video
2. **UI proof** - actual app screen + "Processing / Done"
3. **3-step flow** - Upload → Remove → Download
4. **Comparison card** - Most tools vs BlankLogo
5. **Outcome headline on ugly screenshot** - "Watermark ruins it? Fix it."
6. **Receipt-style** - "Removed ✅ / Quality ✅ / No ads ✅"
7. **"Tried everything" confession** - creator POV text overlay

## 6. Remotion Template Kit

Build 5 Remotion templates and swap screenshots/text for infinite variations:

### 1) `BeforeAfterSplit.tsx`
- Left: "Before" watermark frame
- Right: "After" clean frame
- Animated divider wipe

### 2) `ThreeSteps.tsx`
- 3 cards sliding in: Upload → Remove → Download

## 7. Copy Rules for Conversion

### Do:
- Use short, punchy claims: "Ad-free." "Clean output." "No installs."
- Use contrast: "Built to avoid the usual…"
- Keep text overlays large enough for mobile: **6–10 words max on image**
- Put everything else in primary text

### Don't:
- Avoid vague hype: "AI magic" / "best ever"

---

## 8. Landing Page Alignment

Above the fold on BlankLogo.app should mirror ads:

**Headline:** Remove Watermarks From Videos (Ad-Free Premium Tool)

**Sub:** "Upload a video → get a clean version back. Built for creators."

**3 icon bullets:**
- Quality-first output
- No ads / no gimmicks
- Simple workflow

**Then:** before/after examples + "how it works" + pricing
